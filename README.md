# Nifty Nerds Network (NNN)

Nifty Nerds Network ("NNN"), which gathers several AAA games, is a game-fi launchpad featuring a game-revenue backed token burn structure, continuous sub-token launches, and a gamified user experience.

NNN is the result of a collaboration between AAA game studio alumni, TradiFi/DeFi experts, Web3 native degens, and market makers, creating a unique and powerful network.
